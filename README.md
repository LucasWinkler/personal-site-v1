# personal-website

This website has been built to gain experience and act as a portfolio.

It is being built in HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery and any small libraries that will help.
This website will be rebuilt using React and Bootstrap in the future, but since it
is my first website outside of school it will be in mostly vanilla.
