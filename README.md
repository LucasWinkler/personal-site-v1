# personal-site-v1

This website has been built to gain experience and act as a portfolio (though I have no projects to display).

It is being built in HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery and any small libraries that will help.
This website will be rebuilt using React in the future, but since it
is my first website outside of school I'm going to attempt to create it without any huge libraries/frameworks.


# Version 2 is now live at
